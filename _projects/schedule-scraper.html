<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>Three super easy ways to use this script!</p>

<h2>Bookmarklet (recommended)</h2>
<p>Run the script from a bookmark. Simple and reusable!</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Drag and drop <a class="btn btn-primary bookmarklet" data-display-text="this button"><span style="display: none">Schedule scraper</span></a> into your Bookmarks bar.
    <div class="well">
        <i class="icon-chrome"></i> <b>Chrome:</b> You may need to push <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> to open your Bookmarks bar.<br>
        <i class="icon-firefox"></i> <b>Firefox:</b> Follow <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/bookmarks-toolbar-display-favorite-websites#w_show-or-hide-the-bookmarks-toolbar">Mozilla's instructions</a> to show your Bookmarks bar.<br>
        <i class="icon-safari"></i> <b>Safari:</b> You may need to push <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> to view your Bookmarks bar.
    </div>
    </li>
    <li>Navigate to the timetable to be exported.</li>
    <li>Click the bookmark!
    <div class="well">
        <b>Note:</b> You may need to actually press the "Download .ics file" button that appears above the timetable in order to trigger the download. If this button does not appear then something has gone horribly wrong.
    </div>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Run in address bar</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the timetable to be exported.</li>
    <li>
        In your address bar, delete everything and type <code>javascript:</code>, then paste the following code.
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript selectable bookmarklet"></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Hit <kbd>enter</kbd>!</li>
</ol>
<h2>Run in JavaScript console</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the timetable to be exported.</li>
    <li>Open the JavaScript console with <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd>.</li>
    <li>
        Paste the following script into the console.
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript selectable bookmarklet"></pre>
        <div class="well">
            <i class="icon-firefox"></i><b>Firefox:</b> You may need to type <code>allow pasting</code> into your console to enable pasting into the console. Follow the instructions if they appear.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        Press <kbd>enter</kbd>!
        <div class="well">
            <span class="icon-ie"></span> <b>Internet Explorer:</b> Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd> instead. And stop using Internet Explorer.
        </div>
    </li>
</ol>

<h1>Challenges</h1>
<h2>Cross-Origin Requests</h2>
<p>Most of the data comes from the currently loaded page at <a href="https://acorn.utoronto.ca/sws/welcome.do?welcome.dispatch#/">https://acorn.utoronto.ca/sws/welcome.do?welcome.dispatch#/</a>, but the script also makes a request to <a href="http://www.apsc.utoronto.ca/timetable/fall.html">http://www.apsc.utoronto.ca/timetable/fall.html</a> - the "master" timetable. It pulls professor names and course start dates from this page, which is not included in ACORN. Unfortunately, these two pages reside on different subdomains, so most modern browsers block this request under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">Same Origin Policy</a>.</p>
<p>To resolve this issue, the data needs to be reformatted as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">JSONP</a> by an external server (since you ARE allowed to request scripts cross-domain). I used <a href="http://alloworigin.com/">http://alloworigin.com/</a> since it was allowed HTTPS connections for free. Unfortunately, I managed to <a href="https://github.com/limtaesu/alloworigin/issues/8">send the server into an infinite loop</a>, but a quick reboot managed to fix that issue.</p>
<p>Because loading the 100 MB file through a proxy was taking too long (and unreliable, as the server continually timed out), this feature has been temporarily disabled. I am currently looking to use <a href="https://github.com/cobalt-io/">Cobalt</a>, a third-party RESTful web API for U of T data.</p>
<p>Unfortnuately, since the maintainers of the project are currently unavailable, the script currently makes reads a pre-scraped file in the repository, defaulting to hard-coded sessional dates if a course cannot be found.</p>

<h2>Asynchronous Javascript</h2>
<p>Because AJAX requests are by definition asynchronous, the work to process them has to end up in callback functions. This results in an <a href="http://blog.getify.com/promises-part-2/#nested-callbacks">inversion of control</a> due to callbacks nested within each other deeper and deeper.</p>
<div class="framed">
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript">makeAjaxRequest(function(data) {
        processData(data, function(processedData) {
            displayData(processedData);
        });
    });</pre>
    <p class="caption">"Inversion of control" due to nested callbacks</p>
</div>
<p>One way to handle this would be to implement an event queue that waits for each AJAX call to complete before starting the next. This structure would implicitly pass the output of one function to the input of the next. There is also room for an error handling function.</p>
<div class="framed">
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript">executeSequentially(makeAjaxRequest, processData, displayData, errorHandler);</pre>
    <p class="caption">AJAX queue runner</p>
</div>
<p>However, the prevalent method is to use <a href="https://www.promisejs.org/">Promises</a>.</p>
<div class="framed">
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript">makeAjaxRequest().then(processData).then(displayData);</pre>
    <p class="caption">AJAX calls using promises</p>
</div>
<p>The promises are <code>resolved</code> or <code>rejected</code> inside the callbacks, but the caller never has to worry about that. Promises can simply be chained onto one another and the results of each will be passed to the next.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this project, the <code>Deferred</code> objects provided by <code>JQuery</code> were sufficient, so I avoided the usual loading of a promise library.</p>

<h2>When to execute?</h2>
<p>Not only must the script execute its own asynchronous components at the correct time, but it must also start execution after the document has been loaded. Usually, it is easy to attach the script to an <code>onLoad()</code> event so the script will be run as a callback, but since we do not know when the user will run the script, this is impossible. For example, if the user runs the script before the page is ready, then the script may fail to execute (since part of the page is missing). If the user runs the script after the page has been fully loaded, the <code>onLoad()</code> event has already been called and the script will never be run. Instead, we use the following short snippet to run the script immediately if the page is loaded, but attach the script to <code>onLoad()</code> if not.</p>
<div class="framed">
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript">document.readyState == 'complete' ? run() : window.onload = run;</pre>
    <p class="caption"><code>run</code> immediately if page is loaded, otherwise wait for the page to load.</p>
</div>

<h2>Whitespace</h2>
<p>When testing on my own schedule, it was easy to scrape the correct segments of HTML into JavaScript objects. However, during beta testing it was revealed that arbitrary whitespace/linebreaks could appear throughout the content for different people. This complicated the line-based scraping algorithm, which eventually had to be replaced with a tag-based one. Superfluous use of <code>.trim()</code> also helped mitigate the effects of additional whitespace.</p>
