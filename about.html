summary: I am a third year student at the University of Toronto studying <a href="http://engsci.utoronto.ca/">Engineering Science</a> with a minor in <a href="http://engsci.utoronto.ca/explore_our_program/majors/roboticsengineeringoption/">Robotics</a>. In my free time, I investigate video game artificial intelligence and virtual reality. Some of my other interests include aviation and papercraft. This website documents some technical projects and also personal artwork. Even the creation of the website itself is documented! Click <a href="/projects/website.html">here</a> to read more about the design process of this website.

<h1>Resume</h1>
<p>I am excited to develop revolutionary next-generation technologies such as virtual or augmented reality systems and artificial intelligence. I am also interested in working with autonomous robotics and aviation.</p>
