                <h1>Design Goals</h1>
                <h2>Engaging</h2>
                <h2>Reactive</h2>
                <p>A beautiful website is useless if no one can see it! With so many different devices accessing the internet, it is important to ensure that the website is usable by everyone. Using Twitter Bootstrap's built-in styles and careful CSS formatting, the website is designed to be easy to navigate on any device, regardless of screen size and input method.</p>
                <p>For example, to facilitate touch users, there are no dropdown menus or tooltips that only appear when the cursor is hovering over them. I promise. After all, it's not easy to hover with a touchscreen!</p>
                <p>To accomodate many different screen sizes, Bootstrap's reactive column layout is utilized. See the projects page render in many different viewports below!</p>
                <h2>Maintainable</h2>
                <p>Of course I would like to lower the workload on myself to keep this site up and running. The headers and conserved elements across multiple pages are seperate files loaded in by JQuery. This ensures that the menu bars and navigation features are identical from page to page and allows me to make a single change that affects all the pages.</p>
                <p>The styling is rarely done manually; rather I rely on Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to format the pages. All I have to do to create a page is to tag the correct elements with simple HTML tags. The style sheets also ensure that similar content is styled consistently across the website.</p>
