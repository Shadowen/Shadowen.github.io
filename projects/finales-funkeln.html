                        <h1>Objectives</h1>
                        <p>Follow the blueprints provided to create the circuit, then design and build an enclosure for the circuit. The device must be safe for home use when plugged into an AC power outlet.</p>
                        <h1>Design process</h1>
                        <p>Even though the circuit diagram was given for the circuit, it was still left up to us to decide the layout of the board itself. Planning ahead allowed us to create a clean, properly spaced out final product. Thus resulted in a clean and easily testable circuit.</p>
                        <p>Creating the enclosure introduced more problems. Originally, the project featured an ambitious clear enclosure with EL rods inside. This can be seen in one of the early sketches. However, this also required the addition of logic gates to convert the original 3 channel design into 5 channels. This would greatly increase the complexity of the circuit.</p>
                        <p>It was soon decided to make the case translucent with three segments to improve diffusion of light, and simply rely on the LED lights to provide colour. Time constraints also forced a decision on the enclosure. Fancy shapes would be too time-intensive to mould, so a simple rectangular shape was picked to minimize construction time.</p>
                        <p>Safety was also a large concern during the creation of the enclosure, since the device would be operating on 120V from a wall-socket. The material chosen for the case was plastic (acrylic) since it is nonconductive. All of the circuit components are fully enclosed in the case when the lid is closed. Exposed wire and solder was covered with heat shrink or electrical tape. For additional safety, the circuit is fused. A replacable fuse is inserted into a receptacle accessible from the outside.</p>
                        <p>Overall, this project taught me a lot about which corners can be cut in order to achieve objectives, and which corners cannot be cut.</p>
